Experimenting with squad-based game mechanics for an RTS to run on mobile platforms.

My approach of using advanced steering behaviour combined with fixed-point arithmetics for lockstep-multiplayer, proved to be a performance-breaker on mobile devices. Especially since the aim was to allow for 30 units per squad, with up to 8 sqauds. 

Therefore, I scrapped this project.

The behaviours that were implemented looked really fantastic though.
